If you’re looking for the world’s best sesame seeds, look no further than Humera, Ethiopia. 
Nestled in the Tigray region near the Eritrean and Sudanese borders, Humera is home to small farms that produce sesame seeds renowned for their incredible quality. 
These seeds aren’t just a crop—they’re a global treasure, especially for making the creamiest tahini.

Humera sesame seeds stand out for their buttery, complex flavor and high oil content, often exceeding 50%. 
Their bright white color and plump size make them visually stunning, while their nutty, slightly sweet taste elevates any dish. 
Prized worldwide, they’re the gold standard for tahini production, sought after by markets in the Middle East, China, Europe, and the U.S. 
Ethiopia, the third-largest sesame exporter globally, sees over 70% of its sesame exports as the Humera variety, with more than 300,000 metric tons shipped in 2023 alone.

What makes these seeds so special? It starts with the small farms in Humera, where farmers hand-harvest the seeds with care, shaking the stalks to release them from their pods. 
The region’s rich soils and ideal climate—reliable spring rains and a frost-free growing season from July to late November—create perfect conditions for the seeds to thrive. 
These family-run farms, often spanning just a few acres, rely on traditional methods, ensuring the seeds remain pure and organic. 
Many farmers work with cooperatives, like those supported by Tradin Organic, which provide training to improve yields while maintaining sustainable practices.
